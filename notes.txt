ReactJS and Rails

---
Docker note:
Using the Phusion Passenger image, we need to create our own user in the
Dockerfile,
and specify that it is used in the nginx config:

RUN useradd -s /bin/bash -u1000 rubyapps

In the container, we can then install the gems with
bundle install --path vendor/bundle

Architectural Overview
----------------------

Object-Relational Mapping/Active Record

Rails application:

Web request -> View + Controller + Model

# Our React application View layer:

Web request -> JSON API + HTML + CSS/JavaScript
The JSON API returns data. We serve HTML, CSS, and JS

# View technologies:

JBuilder  --- RoR method to generate JSON
ERB       --- generate HTML
Sprockets --- compiles JS to serve via the asset pipeline

We will also use Babel ES6 to transpile into JS.

Isomorphic refactor to serve both client and server side.

Express (Node.js) - for delivering the app
Webpack (Node.js) - JS compilation and serving

002 Scaffolding the Rails Application
-------------------------------------

# Create the application
rails new <application_name>

# We remove spring, coffeescript, jquery and turbolinks from the Gemfile

# We add the following gems:
gem 'ancestry'    # quickly and easily model trees
gem 'rails_admin' # helps build admin interface to add/remove records

# Let's create a migration
bundle exec rails g migration create_restaurants

# We'll edit the migration file:

class CreateRestaurants < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :restaurants do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :address
      t.text :description
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

# and run the migration:
bundle exec rake db:migrate

# Next, we need to create the model
class Restaurant < ActiveRecord::Base
end

# We can then use the rails_admin generator to make some forms for us:
bundle exec rails g rails_admin:install

# This adds rails_admin as an engine for us. After restarting the rails
# server, we can access the admin page:
localhost:3000/admin

# We add a Comment model, with a belongs_to Restaurant relationship:

class CreateComments < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :comments do |t|
      t.string :author
      t.text :body
      t.integer :rank
      t.belongs_to :restaurant
      t.timestamps
    end
    add_index :comments, :restaurant_id
  end
end

# The following lines are added to restaurant.rb and comment.rb respectively
# has_many :comments
# belongs_to :restaurant

# We are going to use the ancestry gem to set comments up as trees
# for this, we need a migration with index:

bundle exec rails g migration add_ancestry_to_comments

class AddAncestryToComments < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :comments, :ancestry, :string
    add_index :comments, :ancestry
  end
end

# We need to modify the comments model for use with ancestry:

class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :restaurant
  validates :restaurant, presence: true
  has_ancestry
end

# In a Rails console, we can create a child comment:
Comment.create(author: "Jane", body: "Quite right!", parent: Comment.find(1),
 restaurant_id: 1)

# And we can inspect the parent's children:
Comment.find(1).children

# and the path:
Comment.find(1).path
